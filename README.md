## Description

This is a Prework Study Guide for students in a bootcamp going through prework. It contains some information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Through this project I learned the basics of how to apply these to a webpage and how to use Git Bash.

The Prework Study Guide can be used to go over brief information on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Each section contains notes on these topics for review. If DevTools Console is opened, either by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), JavaScript is shown running in the console panel and helps decide what to study first!
